# Appointment Booking Agent

A conversational AI-powered appointment booking system that automates the process of capturing user details, saving them in a database, and scheduling events in Google Calendar â€” all handled by an OpenAI Agent using MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers.

##  Overview

This project leverages the power of the **OpenAI Agents SDK** and **MCP servers** to build a seamless AI agent that:
- Interacts with users through a chat widget
- Collects booking information using a structured form
- Saves appointments in a **Supabase database** via Supabase MCP Server
- Creates corresponding calendar events using the **Google Calendar MCP Server**
-  Sending Emails to both owner and customer using **SMTP server**

No custom REST APIs are needed â€” the agent calls tools declaratively using context.
